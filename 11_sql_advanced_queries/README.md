# Advanced SQL Queries

If we're looking at our SQL inside our terminal, it helps to use these settings:
```
.mode column  #=> when selecting, moves the data into columns
.headers on   #=> enables column names when looking at our data
.width auto   #=> modifies the width to automatically fit our terminal
```

In order to see our schema: `.schema`

Don't forget the semi-colon to finish a query!

## Basic CRUD

To create a table we use:
```
CREATE TABLE people (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  age INTEGER,
);
```

To add a new column:
```
ALTER TABLE people
ADD favorite_movie TEXT;
```

To create an entry:
```
INSERT INTO people (name, age, favorite_movie)
VALUES ("Chett", 6, "The Lion King");
```

To see all entries:
```
SELECT * FROM people;
```

To see a specific entry:
```
SELECT * FROM people
WHERE favorite_movie = 1;
```

To update an entry:
```
UPDATE people
SET age = 60, name = "Mister Chett"
WHERE id = 1;
```

To delete an entry:
```
DELETE FROM people
WHERE id = 1;
```
